Today marks the end of my first month working at Twitter, on Crashlytics.


A month ago I could not have come close to doing the work that I do today.
This past month I was introduced to a wide variety of technologies, and expected
to manage, deploy and build new distributed systems. I was introduced to _Cassandra_,
an awesome column-based datastore; _Cascading_, a Java DSL for Hadoop MapReduce; and
expected to build and deploy new _Storm_ topologies.


So how will I summarize my first month at Twitter? Like many other engineers, in
order to quantify something, I first turn to data. Perhaps unsurprisingly,  I wrote
a quick [python script](https://gist.github.com/wcdolphin/5841544) to count
my contributions which had been merged into the master branches of our repositories.

The result summarize my first month pretty well:

Since May 20, [@wcdolpin](https://twitter.com/wcdolphin) has made _55 commits_
in _9 different languages_, editing _77 different files_ in _5 different
repositories_.

It has been a whirlwind, and I am excited to begin my second month.
