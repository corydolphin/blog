###Oh how different the story could have been:
The DOD was blind while hostile forces attacked our country. Silently and invisibly, foreign forces moved troops and supplies during dusk, coordinating a devastating attack. Lacking funding to upgrade and retrofit their satellites' telescopes, the DOD was unable to see and predict the attack, leaving us blind. Meanwhile, NASA stared deep into the galaxy, drawing the lines of constellations and guessing about the origins of the universe.

I just read a very interesting article by Alexis Madrigal describing how "our military had two, unflown, better-than-Hubble space telescopes just sitting around."

Reading the article and commentary from a wide variety of sources, there was a discernible trend: many individuals (the author included) felt that the distribution of funding indicated by the DOD's surplus was troubling. At first, I agreed entirely. It seemed strange that our economic environment allowed NASA to be struggling for funding whilst another agency seemed to be wasting budget. The distribution seemed to imply that we did not wish to focus on research and rather upon war. Further, it begged to question just how powerful the DOD's other telescopes could be, if these held such small value that they could simply be gifted.

But then, I stopped. And after a moment, I realized that a very different story could have been told. Imagine the opposite was true (as many people implied). Imagine that as NASA was stargazing (of course, this is not entirely what they do), our nation was attacked because the DOD did not have access to the equipment it needed. What would HackerNew's and the public's reaction be in that case? It is hard to imagine anything but outrage.

While it may be the case that we are dealing with two economic and thus moral extremes, I think it quite simply illustrates that fundamentally we are conflicted in the distribution of resources, but that it is a very difficult task. On the one hand there are things both tangible and intangible to be discovered in the cosmos (planetary bodies, or deeper understanding of our physical universe), whilst on the other there is a looming unknown, one which can cause great harm.

If it is life or stargazing, I think I may just have to choose life. This one time.
