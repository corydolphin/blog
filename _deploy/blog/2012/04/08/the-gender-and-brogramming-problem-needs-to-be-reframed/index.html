	<h1 class="title" itemprop="name">The Gender and Brogramming Problem Needs to Be Reframed.</h1>
	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>There are gender related issues in the software industry, in startup communities, and in many different places. Just looking at HackerNews and the twittersphere you can see how popular the <a href="http://motherjones.com/media/2012/04/silicon-valley-brogrammer-culture-sexist-sxsw">&#8220;Gangbang Interviews&#8221; and &#8220;Bikini Shots&#8221;: Silicon Valley’s Brogrammer Problem</a> article is.</p>

<p>This topic is well written about and I have no new value to add to the wealth of information and brilliant analysis. These issues run deep, they are deeply ingrained in the social context in which we are educated and live in, sometimes they are very blatant (center image), sometimes they are less obvious (but no less significant (left and right)).</p>

<p><img class="center" src="./images/posts/brogrammer_both_girl.jpg" width="400" height="500" title="&#34;Brogramming? Or something?&#34;" alt="&#34;Brogramming? Or something?&#34;"></p>

<h2>What I want to talk about is how we describe these issues, and how we frame these issues.</h2>

<p>Currently the way that the problem is phrased, men are immediately made defensive. And you can&#8217;t blame them (even if you can, you must will yourself to understand why they feel this way). Men feel attacked, because in essence, their wrongs are being pointed out&#8211; men are being scolded, publicly and with great humiliation. Sponsorship is removed and public twitter spates occur, where men are (rightly so) told how wrong they are, and often times in ways that seem like personal attacks. Often times actions are pointed out as being sexist or derisive, and the protagonist of these actions obviously feels as though those same characteristics are being bestowed upon him. Hell, sometimes they are intentionally bestowed upon the protoganist:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
@<a href="https://twitter.com/csanz">csanz</a> @<a href="https://twitter.com/rekatz">rekatz</a> and even by allowing it to be posted without making it clear it isn&#8217;t your brand or your values- you can do better.<br />

<h2>Our current approach accomplishes nothing</h2>

<p>If men get defensive, they will band together and get more defensive, and this solves nothing (actually, this is largely what caused the issue in the beginning). What we need to do is reframe the problem, we need to make it easy for men to agree with the issues being pointed out. We need to work to understand how we can discuss these issues in a way such that men do not feel attacked. Not because we want to be &#8216;nice&#8217; or &#8216;gentle&#8217; towards men, but because we want to see change. We want these gender issues to be addressed, and in order for that to happen we must have men acknowledge it and think about it, and change it. (And women too!)  I don&#8217;t quite know how yet, but I know that there are many smart people out there that can invent great ways to communicate this issue such that we boys/men don&#8217;t feel attacked.</p>

<p>*Note that in these musings, I refer to the group which must be driven to action as men, while there is of course a variety of different genders that actually need to be driven to action on the issue.</p>
